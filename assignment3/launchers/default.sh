# VEHICLE_NAME: On a Duckiebot, /environment.sh (from Duckietown base images) and/or
# dts typically set this to the robot hostname when you use `dts devel run -H <robot>`.
# Official docs also note it may be unset in some setups (fallback default is used).
# This launcher passes veh:=${VEHICLE_NAME} into roslaunch; set VEHICLE_NAME manually
# before `dts devel run` only if your container does not define it and defaults are wrong.
